                                will never charge your credit card. You will pay for your stay at the hotel.

                                <p class="question">Q:Does the hotel need a deposit or a payment in advance?</p>
                                <p class="answer"> Ans:You will pay for your stay at the hotel. If the hotel
                                    requires a deposit,
                                    it
                                    will be clearly mentioned on the overview page of the hotel. However, note
                                    that
                                    some hotels perform a pre-authorization check on your credit card as an
                                    extra
                                    guarantee. A pre–authorization is a validity check to reserve a certain
                                    amount
                                    that would guarantee the room. This amount may correspond to the price of
                                    one
                                    night or to the total costs of your reservation. Once the credit card has
                                    been
                                    validated, the reserved amount will be released.</p>



                                <p class="question">Q:What types of credit card can I use to guarantee the
                                    reservation?</p>
                                <p class="answer">Ans:MasterCard, Visa and American Express are accepted as a
                                    guarantee. However,
                                    it
                                    is possible that the hotel does not accept all of these for payment. Please
                                    check at the bottom of the overview page of the hotel the “Hotel Policies”
                                    section for ‘Accepted credit cards.’</p>

                                </p>
                                <p class="answer">Ans: Please note that such arrangements depend on each
                                    hotel’s policy.
                                    Therefore, you
                                    will need to contact the hotel directly. The hotel’s contact details
                                    can be
                                    found in the confirmation e-mail of your reservation.

                                    used to guarantee the reservation?</p>
                                <p class="answer">Ans: As the credit card details are only needed for
                                    guarantee purposes, you can pay
                                    at the hotel using the method of payment of your choice.</p>

                            <p class="answer"> Ans:The most common reason for not getting a confirmation email
                                is typing your
                                email
                                address incorrectly. Therefore, please double check your email address

                                finalizing your reservation. Also we have noticed that in some cases our
                                confirmation email may end up in your "spam folder". If you do not receive
